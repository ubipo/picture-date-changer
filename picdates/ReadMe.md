## Usage

```js
import { extractDate } from "picdates/date-from-file.mjs"

extractDate("/path/to/picture.jpeg")
```
..which returns either a [dayjs] datetime object, or `null` if no date
was found (neither in the Exif metadata, nor in the filename).

## Test data

See [`test/output.md`](test/output.md), which is generated by
[`test/main.mjs`](test/main.mjs), based on the client's test data.

Note that the actual image files are not included in this git repository.\
They have to be downloaded from Dropbox.\
(And the `pictureDir` path in `test/main.mjs` must be updated to match).


## Dev docs

### To-do list:
- [x] Comparing parsed dates w/ client labels (ground truth)
- [x] Fix `dateFromExif: Invalid Date` (wss. een ander formaat voor dayjs nodig)
- [ ] _Writing_ EXIF data. (See https://piexifjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#how-to-use)

### On Date parsing
Built-in `Date` does not do arbitrary format parsing (at least not officially).\
moment.js is being deprecated.\
I choose dayjs instead, which is one of the libs that the momentjs authors now recommend.

Currently we have hardcoded parse date formats.\
We could supply an array of them to handle multiple (https://day.js.org/docs/en/parse/string-format)

### On Exif I/O.
There's just one library that also writes: `piexif`.\
